The Basic Calculator App project is a straightforward and essential software application developed using Python with the Kivy framework. This application was designed to serve as a fundamental tool for performing arithmetic calculations with ease and simplicity. The calculator offers a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Key Features:

-> User-Friendly Interface:

-> The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies navigation and operation.
The calculator layout comprises numerical buttons, arithmetic operators, and a display screen for both input and result presentation.
Arithmetic Operations:

->The calculator supports four primary arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It allows users to perform calculations involving integers and decimal numbers.
Input Validation:

->The calculator employs input validation to ensure the accuracy of mathematical operations.
It adeptly manages typical input errors like division by zero or invalid expressions.
Clear and Delete Functions:

->Users can easily clear the entire input field with the "C" (Clear) button or remove the last character with the "DEL" (Delete) button.
Real-Time Result Display:

->The calculator instantly displays the result of each operation, enabling users to observe the outcome of their calculations promptly.
User-Friendly Error Handling:

->In the event of invalid operations or errors, the calculator provides user-friendly error messages to guide the user.
Technology Stack:

Python: The primary programming language used to develop the application.
Kivy: A Python framework employed for building the graphical user interface and enhancing the user experience.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and project management.
